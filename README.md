# speechbox

Command line toolbox for managing the state of speech data classification experiments.

Currently a terrible mess.

## Installing

Make sure you have [`sox`](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) installed and on your path.

Installing with pip (you might want to use a clean virtual environment):
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/matiaslindgren/speechbox.git
cd speechbox
pip install --editable .
```

See the `test` directory on how to do some tests to make sure everything is working.
