# speechbox

Command line toolbox for managing speech data classification experiments.

The slightly more sane alternative to a legacy shell script spaghetti of hard-coded paths.

## Quickstart

Make sure you have [`sox`](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) installed and on your path.

Install with pip (you might want to use a clean virtual environment):
```bash
pip install https://github.com/matiaslindgren/speechbox/archive/master.zip
```
Run the example recipe to check everything is working:
```bash
./example_recipe.sh
```
